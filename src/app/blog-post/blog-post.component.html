                Don't you think the allegations can be fraud as well. Why the alleged priest Sanji Ram and all other prospects are asking for the CBI investigation themselves. They are asking for their NARCO test themselves, they are pretty sure that they are being trapped in this. Instead the state govt. is not willing to go for CBI investigation but started calling them rapist without any proper investigation. I dont hold-on their support I am just waiting for the proper investigation. How can MEDIA start calling some one rapist when it is not yet proved. Why The family of that girl doesn't want to go through the NARCO test. This actually refers that their is definitely something which is concealed. Why doesn't media protest for proper investigation so that you can make a video which is fool proof instead of defaming someone who may come out innocent. How can a alleged person be portrayed as a guilty without a proper investigation.# I don't support the alleged people but I am definitely against this Media Terend. #KathuaRapeCase.
